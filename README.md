WePair Health is an MVP and due to the proprietary nature of the code I can only provide code snippets of the pieces I designed.

This doesn't represent the entirety of the code I wrote for this project. I chose the 3 projects that no one else really had a hand in order to reduce
the amount of code I had to remove.
